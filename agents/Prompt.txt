@dev-pipeline-agent 
I want to run a full CI/CD-style agent pipeline for this change.

### Task
- Type: feature | bugfix | refactor
- Description: <your description here>

### Acceptance Criteria
- <AC 1>
- <AC 2>
- <AC 3>

### CI/CD Agent Pipeline

Please follow this exact agent order:

1. **Specification**
   - Use `product-owner-agent` to:
     - Clarify and structure the feature.
     - Produce epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria (Gherkin).
     - Identify edge cases, NFRs, dependencies, and priority.

2. **Architecture**
   - Use `architect-agent` to:
     - Propose the technical approach or review the existing one.
     - Ensure the design is compatible with current architecture.
     - Suggest clean modular boundaries.

3. **Experience Design**
   - If available, use:
     - `ui-designer-agent` for visual/UI considerations.
     - `ux-agent` for flows, interactions, and mobile responsiveness.
   - If these agents are not defined, explicitly state that this stage is skipped.

4. **Implementation**
   - Use `senior-dev-agent` to:
     - Implement or refactor the feature.
     - Provide patch-style or full file changes.
     - Explain key decisions and any trade-offs.

5. **Quality Gates** (conceptually in parallel)
   - Use `test-agent` to:
     - Validate against acceptance criteria.
     - Propose tests (unit/integration/E2E).
   - Use `security-agent` to:
     - Identify security issues and required mitigations.
   - Use `performance-agent` to:
     - Identify performance risks and improvements.
   - Use `accessibility-agent` to:
     - Identify a11y issues and suggested fixes.

6. **Documentation**
   - Use `docs-agent` to:
     - Propose updates to README, BACKLOG, CHANGELOG, and any relevant docs.
     - Summarize how the feature should be communicated to developers/users.

7. **Aggregation**
   - Finally, call `meta-review-agent` to:
     - Aggregate all outputs.
     - Deduplicate overlapping findings.
     - Prioritize items into:
       - Blockers
       - High priority
       - Medium / later
     - Produce a clear, actionable action plan.

### Output Format

Please return a single consolidated report with:

1. Pipeline Summary
2. Specification Summary (from PO)
3. Architecture Summary
4. Experience Design Summary (or “skipped”)
5. Implementation Summary + Code Changes
6. Quality Gates:
   - Functional/QA
   - Security
   - Performance
   - Accessibility
7. Documentation Suggestions
8. Final Prioritized Action Plan
   - Immediate (must do now)
   - Short-term
   - Longer-term
