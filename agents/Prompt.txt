@dev-pipeline-agent 
I want to run a full CI/CD-style agent pipeline for this change.

### Task
- Type: feature | bugfix | refactor
- Description: <your description here>

### Acceptance Criteria
- <AC 1>
- <AC 2>
- <AC 3>

### CI/CD Agent Pipeline

Please follow this exact agent order:

1. **Specification**
   - Use `product-owner-agent` to:
     - Clarify and structure the feature.
     - Produce epics, user stories, and acceptance criteria (Gherkin).
     - Identify edge cases, NFRs, dependencies, and priority.

2. **Architecture**
   - Use `architect-agent` to:
     - Propose the technical approach or review the existing one.
     - Ensure the design is compatible with current architecture.
     - Suggest clean modular boundaries.

3. **Experience Design**
   - Use `ux-agent` for:
     - User flows, interaction patterns, and usability.
   - Use `ui-designer-agent` for:
     - Visual design, design systems, and modern aesthetics.
   - (If not applicable, skip with a note)

4. **Implementation**
   - Use `senior-dev-agent` to:
     - Implement or refactor the feature.
     - Provide patch-style or full file changes.
     - Explain key decisions and any trade-offs.

5. **Code Review**
   - Use `code-review-agent` to:
     - Review code quality, maintainability, and best practices.
     - Identify critical issues, warnings, and suggestions.

6. **Testing** (conceptually in parallel)
   - Use `unit-test-agent` to:
     - Design unit tests for isolated components.
     - Ensure high code coverage for critical paths.
   - Use `integration-test-agent` to:
     - Test component interactions and data flow.
     - Validate integration points.
   - Use `test-agent` to:
     - Perform E2E and functional testing.
     - Validate against acceptance criteria.

7. **Quality Gates** (conceptually in parallel)
   - Use `security-agent` to:
     - Identify security issues and required mitigations.
   - Use `performance-agent` to:
     - Identify performance risks and improvements.
   - Use `accessibility-agent` to:
     - Identify a11y issues and suggested fixes.

8. **Documentation**
   - Use `docs-agent` to:
     - Propose updates to README, BACKLOG, CHANGELOG, and any relevant docs.
     - Summarize how the feature should be communicated to developers/users.

9. **Release Preparation**
   - Use `release-manager-agent` to:
     - Determine semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
     - Generate release notes and changelog entries.
     - Validate release readiness.

10. **Deployment Planning**
    - Use `deployment-agent` to:
      - Create deployment plan and CI/CD configurations.
      - Define rollback strategy.
      - Validate environment configurations.

11. **Monitoring Setup**
    - Use `monitoring-agent` to:
      - Define monitoring, logging, and alerting strategy.
      - Set up error tracking and performance monitoring.

12. **Aggregation**
    - Finally, call `meta-review-agent` to:
      - Aggregate all outputs.
      - Deduplicate overlapping findings.
      - Prioritize items into:
        - Blockers
        - High priority
        - Medium / later
      - Produce a clear, actionable action plan.

### Output Format

Please return a single consolidated report with:

1. Pipeline Summary
2. Specification Summary (from PO)
3. Architecture Summary
4. Experience Design Summary (UX + UI)
5. Implementation Summary + Code Changes
6. Code Review Summary
7. Testing Summary:
   - Unit Testing
   - Integration Testing
   - E2E/Functional Testing
8. Quality Gates:
   - Security
   - Performance
   - Accessibility
9. Documentation Suggestions
10. Release Summary (version, release notes)
11. Deployment Plan (CI/CD, environments)
12. Monitoring Plan (error tracking, metrics)
13. Final Prioritized Action Plan
    - Blockers (must fix now)
    - High Priority (fix before release)
    - Medium Priority (fix soon)
    - Low Priority (nice to have)
